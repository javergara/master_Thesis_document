The scope of this work is to apply traditional data augmentation and artificial data generation techniques to asses the performance of object detection deep learning models in banana disease detection tasks. It aims to:

\begin{itemize}
\item To create a banana diseases data set to train object detection deep learning models 
\item To evaluate traditional and novel techniques for data augmentation 
\item To compare the performance of object detection deep learning models using real, artificial and combined data. 
\item To document the workflow and the results of this work    
\end{itemize}
