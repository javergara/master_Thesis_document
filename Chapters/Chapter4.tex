\section{General Objective} 
To evaluate the performance of object detection deep learning models using traditional data augmentation and artificial data generation techniques in banana disease detection. 
\section{Specific Objectives} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item To create and label banana diseases data set
\item To train Generative adversarial networks to generate artificial banana diseases images
\item To generate two data sets of artificial images using traditional data augmentation techniques and GAN models
\item To train object detection deep learning models with the real, augmented, artificial and combined data sets
\item To evaluate and compare the performance of the trained models.
\end{itemize}
