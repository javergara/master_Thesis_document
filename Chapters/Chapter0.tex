\chapter*{Abstract}


In Banana, early pests and diseases diagnosis is a crucial point due to most of these problems can be managed if they are early detected, pests and diseases affect a significant percentage of yield and food production this threat the local and global food security. New technologies are called to generate useful tools in the early diagnosis and disease detection tasks. Mobile applications with artificial intelligence and deep learning utilities could lead farmers in these tasks, but to train deep learning models is needed larger data sets which are not easy to generate, data augmentation techniques and artificially generated images are a good idea to face poor data problems. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate traditional data augmentation and artificial data generation techniques to increase the performance in deep learning models.
